## About

Welcome to the Astro Planner Travel App, a project dedicated to helping travel enthusiasts plan their journeys with celestial beauty. With this app, users can embark on a cosmic travel experience and explore destinations like never before.

## User Registration and Login

To begin using the Astro Planner Travel App, users first need to create an account by registering. If they already have an account, they can simply log in using their credentials.

## Creating a Travel Itinerary

After registration or login, users can create a travel itinerary. Here's how they do it:

a. Choose Destination: Users can select their desired travel destination.
b. Departure and Arrival Date: Users specify the dates when they plan to depart and return from their trip.
c. Flight, Hotel, and Car Rental Forms: Users have the option to enter specific details about their travel, such as their flight details, hotel accommodations, and car rental information. These forms allow users to input the relevant data for each part of their trip.
d. Skip Option: If users prefer to fill out these details later or if they don't have specific information at the moment, they can choose to skip this step and proceed to the next page.

Itinerary Creation: Once the necessary travel details are provided, the app generates an itinerary for the user's trip. This itinerary includes all the information about flights, hotel stays, and car rentals, helping users to visualize and organize their travel plans.

# Managing Your Trips
Users have the option to manage their created trips. They can edit the details of an existing trip or delete it if their plans change or if they no longer need the trip information.
